Esri Case #01769616

Hi Drew,

This is Freddie with Esri Support Services. I am a senior ArcObjects SDK analyst. It was a pleasure speaking with you on the phone today. The issue you're seeing is related to a bug in the Visual Studio 2015 compiler. As a workaround you can try installing Visual Studio 2013 next to your Visual Studio 2015 install, run a repair the ArcObjects .NET SDK to reinstall the integration features, and then recompile your code in Visual Studio 2013. I have attached this case to the following bug in our system.

BUG-000095459 : Some write only properties are missing in ArcObjects, VB.NET, and Visual Studio 2015 and the "BC30643 Property is of an unsupported type" compile error shows up on those properties.

Let me know if the workaround works for you. Also, in regards to your question about using the TableSort against SDE try testing your SDE data against the sample I provided you during the screenshare. If the code fails to work against your SDE data we can have another case logged to look into that issue. 

Thank you,
Freddie
